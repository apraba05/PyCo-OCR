# PyCo: Code Recognition with OCR and Tkinter

## Overview

Welcome to PyCo (Python Code OCR), an application that combines Optical Character Recognition (OCR) and Tkinter to allow users to convert handwritten or printed code on paper into digital text. PyCo is designed to streamline the process of transcribing code from physical documents, making it easier for developers to digitize their handwritten or printed code snippets.

## Features

OCR Integration: PyCo uses OCR to recognize and extract text from images of handwritten or printed code.
Tkinter GUI: The application features a user-friendly Tkinter graphical user interface for ease of use and seamless interaction.
Code Output: PyCo translates the recognized text into executable code, providing users with a digital version of their handwritten or printed code.

## Installation

Clone the PyCo repository to your local machine:
Copy code
```
git clone https://github.com/your-username/pyco.git
```
Install the required dependencies:
```
pip install pytesseract
pip install tkinter
```

Launch the PyCo application:

Copy code
```
python pyco.py
```
Use the Tkinter GUI to navigate and select an image containing handwritten or printed code.
Click the "Recognize Code" button to initiate the OCR process.
Review and edit the extracted code in the text area provided.
Click the "Generate Output" button to obtain the executable digital version of the code.
